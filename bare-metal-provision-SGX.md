# Provisioning a bare metal server with Intel&reg; Software Guard Extension architecture
{: #bm-server-provision-sgx}

Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) can protect data that uses hardware-based server security. With Intel SGX applications, you can protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. By using trusted execution environments (TEE), known as enclaves, you can encrypt the pieces of your application memory that contains sensitive data while it is in use.
