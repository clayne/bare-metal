# Managing port control for a device
{: #bm-manage-port-control}

Each device that is associated with an account has two network ports that receive incoming traffic â€“ one for public network traffic and one for private network traffic. You can enable or disable these ports at any time to control the network traffic that a device receives.

## Before you begin
{: #bm-port-control-before}

* Go to your console's device menu.
* Make sure that you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.
