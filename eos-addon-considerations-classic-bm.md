# End of support add-ons considerations
{: #eos-os-addon-bm-classic-intro}

If you have software add-ons that are at or past its end-of-support (EOS) date, security and stability risks are possible. The vendor no longer provides updates or security fixes for deprecated add-on versions.
{: short-desc}

Follow the guidance from your software add-on vendor on when to upgrade. IBMÂ® doesn't require you to use supported software add-ons, but you assume the risks that are associated with using outdated software add-ons. Unsupported add-ons don't receive security updates or fixes. Risks with using outdated software addons can include security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues. Plan to modernize your instances' software add-ons before the EOS date. For more information, see [Lifecycle for operating systems and add-ons](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-product-lifecycle-classic).

## Wanclouds&reg; partnership
{: #partner-bm-classic}

IBM has a partnership with Wan clouds. Contact [Wanclouds&reg;](https://wanclouds.net/ibm/request){: external} for more information. Using Wanclouds&reg; support incurs extra costs.
